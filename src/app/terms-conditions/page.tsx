            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">2. Valuation Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
              The online valuation provided by our tool is an estimate based on the information provided by you. The final offer is subject to an on-site physical inspection of the vehicle. We reserve the right to adjust or withdraw any offer based on the actual condition of the car.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">3. User Obligations</h2>
            <p>
              You represent and warrant that the information you provide about your vehicle is accurate and complete. You must be the legal owner or have the legal authority to sell the vehicle.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">4. Selling Process</h2>
            <p>
              Once a price is agreed upon after inspection, we will handle the RTA transfer and payment process. Payment is typically made via secure bank transfer or cash (within legal limits).
            </p>
